To create an API you need:
NodeJS
Express
MongoDB
PostMan
First, go into your project directory and "npm init" to set up NodeJS
This will create a package.json file 
Then, "npm install express --save" to install express for the project
Make sure you have installed mongoDB by checking "mongod --version"
You run your project using "npm file_name"
Actually, in this case we do "node app.js" to run the API's

Instead of having to Ctrl+C every time we want to update our API, we can use "sudo npm install - nodemon"
This automatically updates the API every time we make a change
Now you can run your project using "nodemon file_name" for the result

To access mondoDB through the terminal, 
open a new terminal window and type "mongod" to start a mongo server and keep the window open to use MongoDB.
Then, in the project directory "npm install mongoose --save" and "npm install body-parser --save"
Mongoose is the NodeJS package for modeling MongoDB 
Body-parser allows for app to parse data from requests

"npm install cors" will let us access Cross-Origin Resource Sharing so we can communicate with other servers

"npm install jsonwebtoken" will install JWT authentication to our API

React Instructions:
npx create-react-app my-app
